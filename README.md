## Build Your Own `italy.db` Copy

Use the `sportdb` command line tool to build your own `italy.db` copy
from the plain text fixtures. [More »](https://github.com/openfootball/datafile)


### Alternative I - Use the Quick Starter Templates

Use the quick starter datafile templates to start from scratch. Examples:

Build the database for all Italian clubs, leagues and seasons:

    $ sportdb new it

Build the database for the 2020/21 season:

    $ sportdb new it2020-21

### Alternative II - Do-It-Yourself (DIY) - Downlad and Unpack Zip Archive or Git Clone

Download and unpack the zip archive with the datasets or if you have git installed use the `git clone` command to
get a local copy.

Try in your working folder (that is, `/italy`):

```
$ sportdb build
$ sportdb --verbose build     # or for more (verbose) details incl. debug info
```

This will

- setup a new single-file SQLite database e.g. `./sport.db` and
- read in all datasets in plain text (`.txt`)

That's it.
